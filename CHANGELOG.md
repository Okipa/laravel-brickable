# Changelog

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-brickables/compare/2.2.0...2.2.1)

2021-05-12

* Fixed URLs in action forms to allow brick models to embed other bricks (e.g. a container that contains tiles bricks).

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/Okipa/laravel-brickables/compare/2.1.0...2.2.0)

2021-03-28

* You can now disabled a brick management for an Eloquent model by setting the max number of bricks to `0`. This allows you to only disable one brick or more without having to list all allowed bricks in the `can_only_handle` model configuration.
* Trying to (programmatically) add a brick to a model when the max number of bricks is already reached will now throw a `ModelHasReachedMaxNumberOfBricksException`. This behavior replaces the previous one, which automatically removed the oldest brick when a new brick was programmatically added to an Eloquent model which had reached the max number for this type of brick.
